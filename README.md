# Matplotlib Challenge

[This repository](https://github.com/anulkar/matplotlib-challenge) contains a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/anulkar/matplotlib-challenge/blob/master/Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals.ipynb) that analyzes data from a recent animal study conducted by Pymaceuticals Inc. In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. The notebook contains tables and figures along with key observations and insights from the study data.
